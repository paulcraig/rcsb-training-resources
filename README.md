# rcsb-training-resources
The RCSB PDB frequently offers [training-events](training-events) that explain and demonstrate more advanced or automated approaches to utilizing PDB resources. We believe these resources will provide you with tools to improve your research, teaching and overall productivity as explore macromolecular structures. All materials in this repository are open source.

## Example Use Cases
In addition to resources and materials referenced in RCSB PDB training events ([training-events](training-events)), this repository contains a collection of example files describing various use cases of RCSB.org services ([example-use-cases](example-use-cases)).

| Title | Application | Skill Level |
| :---- | :---------- | :---------: |
| [Fetch_chemical_descriptors.ipynb](example-use-cases/chemical-components/fetch_chemical_descriptors.ipynb), [fetch_chemical_descriptors.py](example-use-cases/chemical-components/fetch_chemical_descriptors.py) | Python script to fetch all chemical component IDs and then fetch the SMILES, InChI, etc. strings associated with them | *Scripting* |

## Skill Levels

Different workshops and use cases require different skills. The skill levels listed above are suggestions for the background needed to effectively use the resources.

* *Novice*. Users who have just begun visiting the [RCSB PDB website](https://rcsb.org/). Before proceeding further, please consider reviewing some of the [PDB 101 Training Resources](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/introduction). 
* *Introductory*. Suitable for frequent RCSB PDB visitors who are comfortable with basic search, download and visualization. 
* *Scripting*. Suitable to RCSB PDB users who are comfortable modifying, cutting and pasting existing Python code.
* *Coding*. Suitable to RCSB PDB users who are comfortable creating code and identifying and implementing new Python libraries.
