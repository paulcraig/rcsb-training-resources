    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many structures in the [RCSB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org) contain chemical components that are not amino acids. This includes cofactors like NAD<sup>+</sup> or thiamine pyrophosphate, substrate analogs, metal ions, or drug candidates. Structure files in the RCSB PDB include these chemical components in clearly structured formats that can be readily identified and retrieved. Each chemical components has a unique alphanumeric identifier (e.g., NDP for NADPH or dihydro-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate) in a number of computer compatible formats. This notebook is designed to help you identify chemical components by their IDs and then fetch the SMILES, InChI, etc. strings associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs: id, name, formula, pdbx_formal_charge, formula_weight, or type\n",
    "Outputs: InChI, InChIKey,SMILES, SMILES_stereo\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this notebook is designed to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run a search to retrieve all desired chemical component IDs\n",
    "2. Use a data API query to retrieve data on all chemical components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks in the Fetch Series\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Fetch Chemical Component IDs* (this notebook)\n",
    "2. Fetch *** (assuming more notebooks are planned in this series)\n",
    "3. Fetch ***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* What types of chemical components are found in the RCSB PDB?\n",
    "* What is a SMILES string? an InChIKey?\n",
    "* How can I obtain computationally compatible versions of chemical components that are found in the RCSB PDB website?\n",
    "* How can I expand or shrink the output from a search?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* To search for and retrieve chemical component data from the RCSB PDB\n",
    "* To store the obtained data in file formats or data structures that will be useful in future computation.\n",
    "\n",
